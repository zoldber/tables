//TODO: This should be the functional block of any table regardless of design or optimization
//      The Row class should be passed a line from file read directly via cosntructor and it
//      should automatically parse data in the fastest and safest way possible. Further, data
//      should be organized for search optimization at the row level (hence tokens will be
//      formatted into search trees withtin each row)
